It's racism in its worst form.</quote><author>Roy Innis</author></result><result><quote>History is not going to be kind to liberals. With their mindless programs, they've managed to do to Black Americans what slavery, Reconstruction, and rank racism found impossible destroy their family and work ethic.</quote><author>Walter Williams</author></result><result><quote>Racism, pollution and the rest of it are themselves very close to extinction.</quote><author>R. Buckminster Fuller, Playboy Interview - February 1972</author></result><result><quote>Kindness and compassion toward all living things is a mark of a civilized society. Conversely, cruelty, whether it is directed against human beings or against animals, is not the exclusive province of any one culture or community of people. Racism, economic deprival, dog fighting and cock fighting, bull fighting and rodeos are cut from the same fabric: violence. Only when we have become nonviolent toward all life will we have learned to live well ourselves.</quote><author>Cesar Chavez, letter</author></result><result><quote>Together we can make a change in the world. Together we can help to stop racism. Together we can help to stop prejudice…we can help the world live without fear.

People of African descent are among those most affected by racism. Too often, they face denial of basic rights such as access to quality health services and education. Such fundamental wrongs have a long and terrible history.”</quote><author>Ban Ki-moon</author></result><result><quote>Heroes of 21st Century, in my honest view, are those who will fight injustice, poverty and racism, improve the quality of life for humans and animals alike, and most importantly, incorporate more sustainability in our daily lives everyday.</quote><author>Deodatta V. Shenai-Khatkhate</author></result><result><quote>The message to take from Anne's story is to stop prejudice and discrimination right at its beginning. Prejudice starts when we speak about THE Jews, THE Arabs, THE Asians, THE Mexicans, THE Blacks, THE Whites. This leads to the feeling that all members of each such group think and act the same. That results in prejudice. Lumping entire groups of people together is RACISM, because it denies the fact that everyone is an individual. Even our own brothers and sisters or parents are not exactly like we are. So how do we dare to lump entire groups of people together? If any German had ever asked Anne to tell something about herself, I think she would be still with us today. However, nobody asked: she was just a Jew! Therefore, never base your opinion about anybody else on the color of that person's skin, or on the passport that a person carries, or on the family that person comes from, but only on what the person says and does and on NOTHING ELSE.</quote><author>Miep Gies</author></result><result><quote>Ageism is the racism of the gay world. We really believe that age—and all of our fears that it carries—will “rub off” on us, the way that racists once believed blackness would.</quote><author>Perry Brass</author></result><result><quote>In this current day and age of global terrorism even the government can't protect every single one of us despite what they claim and how many civil liberties they trample upon during their efforts in the name of national security. Our government should instead play to our strengths - being lovers of freedom - and support and encourage us to arm ourselves from all predators regardless of their specific ideologies and aims: terrorism, racism, sociopathy, and violent crime. THAT would be REAL national security.</quote><author>Rick Ector</author></result></results>
